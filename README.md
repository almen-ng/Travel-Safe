# Travel-Safe

## Scope 
Travel Safe aims to help with travel decisions with the aid of weather predicting software application. The objective is to use a detailed database to draw relations between the input statistics that will deliver a system to assist the user with choosing their future travel location. The system will offer a user-friendly Android based application that allows users to search a specific location's weather status. The application will provide information regarding the occurrence probability of extreme and unwanted weather conditions. The productâ€™s main goal is providing the user with beforehand information to aid in the traveling decisions that are affected by unsettling weather changes.

## Installation and Configuration of Application
In order to run this application, an IDE for Android development should be installed. It is recommended to use Android Studio. The guide will be based on Android Studio.
<ol>
 <li>Plug in an Android device to the Computer via USB</li>
 <li>Open the "Settings" on the device</li>
 <li>Tap on "About Phone"</li>
 <li>Find "Build Number"</li>
 <li>Tap on "Build Number" a total of 7 times in quick succession. A pop-up message stating "You are now a developer!" should appear if done corrrectly</li>
 <li>Go back to "Settings:</li>
 <li>Scroll down to the bottom to find "Developer Options"</li>
 <li>Turn on "USB Debugging"</li>
 <li>Dialog appears asking permission for USB Debugging ("Allow USB Debugging?"). Check "Always allow from this computer" and hit "OK"</li>

 <li>An installation page will appear on the device. Follow the guidelines to finish the installation.</li>
</ol>
## How To Use the Application

## Algorithms Used
<ul>
 <li> Merge sort was used to stort the hazards by month so that the search data can be used for binary search to find the specific hazards occuring at a month </li>
 <li> Dijkstra's algorithm was used to find the shortest path between states using the frequency of hazards within a specified state and month as weights. </li>
</ul>
